<h4><strong>About...</strong></h4>

<strong>
<p>
    This new and exciting page is a fine creation made by a small and ambitious group:
    <i>Team 13</i>. <i>Hello notes</i> is a web application made specifically to create,
    manage and organize your notes in a way never seen before. However, <i>Hello notes</i> is
    even more than that! It enables you to create multiple tags in different colors
    which can label your notes,
    and even allows you to share your notes with other users!
</p>
<p>
    Let's start with the basics: after your registration (which you can do via <i>Facebook</i> as well),
    you can edit your profile at any time by clicking your username at the top. When you're
    satisfied with your profile, it's time to create your first note! Just click on the <i>New note</i> button
    on the left side and the form will open up with required fields (have in mind,
    it is not allowed to create an empty note). After you chose a title of your note,
    you can enter the content.
</p>
<p>
    Before we move on to the next field, let's talk about tags! If you haven't created a tag yet,
    you can do that by clicking on the <i>New tag</i> button. Then, a form will open up
    allowing you to choose a name of your tag. In addition, by moving the three sliders left and right
    you can choose any color you can imagine - that will be the color of your tag!
    Then, by clicking submit, the tag will be created.
    Now, this tag should be visible on the left side of your screen.
    After you've added some notes to
    your tag, by clicking on that tag you can see all of those notes.
    If you don't need a tag anymore, just use right-click it and you will be asked
    wether you really want to delete the tag. By clicking 'OK', the tag will be deleted. <br>
    <i>You can see all the notes you've created by clicking on the button <b>My notes</b></i>.
</p>
<p>
    Now, let's get back to creating our note! Now that we have a tag, you can chose
    it for your note. Also, you can choose not to select any tag. Now, you can also choose
    a collaborator for your note. A <b>collaborator</b> on a certain note is a user
    who has acces to that note and can edit it, rename it, add other collaborators and,
    yes, even delete the note. After choosing the collaborator, click <i>Send</i>
    and if everything is OK, you should be able to see the list of added collaborators
    and a message saying <i>User found</i>.
    If you also choose a tag for that note and a color,
    the collaborator will see that color and have access to that tag. But, you needn't
    worry, the collaborator isn't allowed to delete your tag, or to see your notes
    that belong to the tag, but you didn't share them with him/her.
</p>
<p>
    The next step in creating a note is choosing a file (if you want). Just click on
    the button and a window will open allowing you to search your computer for the
    desired file. After that, you're all done! Just click <i>Save</i> and you should
    be able to see your newly created note. If you're not satisfied with the note,
    you can edit it by clciking on the pencil inside the frame of the note. Again,
    a form will open up offering you the same options, only now you can remove
    a collaborator, or remove the tag. Also, by clicking on the <i>trash can</i> icon,
    you can delete the note.
</p>
<p>
    If at any time you feel 'lost' in all the notes, you can search them using the
    search bar. Bear in mind: the phrase should be at least three characters long.
